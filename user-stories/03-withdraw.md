As an investor, when I navigate to the withdraw section of the EquiRock website, I expect to see a clear and user-friendly interface that allows me to easily sell ETF shares in exchange for USDT.

Upon opening the withdraw section, I should see my current ETF share balance displayed prominently on the page. This will help me to quickly and easily see how many shares I have available for sale.

To initiate a sale, I should be able to use an input and connected slider to choose how many shares I want to sell. This should be a simple and intuitive process, and I should be able to see how much USDT I will receive in exchange for my shares.

To ensure that I am comfortable with the transaction, the website should display a summary of the transaction details, including the number of ETF shares being sold, the current market price of the shares, and the amount of USDT I will receive in exchange. This will help me to make an informed decision about whether or not to proceed with the sale.

Once I have confirmed the transaction, the ETF shares that I have sold should be immediately burned, which will ensure that my share balance is updated accurately. At the same time, I should receive the USDT proceeds of the sale in my account.
