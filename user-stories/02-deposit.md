As an investor, when I navigate to the deposit section of the EquiRock website, I expect to see a clear and user-friendly interface that allows me to easily deposit funds in exchange for ETF shares.

Upon opening the deposit section, I should see an input field where I can enter the amount of USDT I want to deposit. This input should be easy to locate and use, and it should also be clearly labeled so that I know exactly what I'm doing.

The input should have a maximum deposit limit that is equal to my current USDT balance.

Once I have entered the desired amount of USDT, I should be able to confirm the deposit transaction with a single click. The website should then display a confirmation screen that includes a summary of the transaction details, such as the amount of USDT deposited, the number of ETF shares that I will receive in exchange, and any applicable fees or charges.

To help me understand how my USDT deposit is being invested, the website should also display a breakdown of how my funds are being split across the underlying basket of assets. This will allow me to see exactly which cryptocurrencies and tokens I am investing in and how my portfolio is diversified.
